# Getting Started

This section will help you build a basic VitePress documentation site from ground up. If you already have an existing project and would like to keep documentation inside the project, start from Step 2.


::: warning
VitePress is currently in `alpha` status. It is already suitable for out-of-the-box documentation use, but the config and theming API may still change between minor releases.
